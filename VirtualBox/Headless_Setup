The end goal is to run linux in a VM and use the applications as if they were
integrated into your windows OS.

The cons
--------
- File systems are separate (you can work around by connecting to FTP on the VM)
- Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client hates you and you can't rig your routes

The pros
--------
-You get the power of linux inside the comfort of your windows OS.

Things to install
-----------------
VirtualBox - https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
This will house our Linux install. I also installed the Oracle VM Extension Pack
for the USB support.

PuTTY - http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
Downloaded the windows installer.

Xming  - http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/
This is our X windowing system to run the windows that would normally be in our 
Linux guest, directly in windows. Also during install, told it where PuTTY is.

Fedora - http://fedoraproject.org/
You should be able use whatever distro of Linux that you want though. As long as it 
supports X11


Setup
-----
Make sure VM has following settings taken care of.
General > Advanced > Shared Clipboard > Bidirectional
General > Advanced > Drag'n'Drop > Bidirectional
General > Advanced > Mini ToolBar: Show in Fullscreen/Seamless > Unchecked
Network > Adapter 1 > Attached to: (Bridged Adapter OR NAT)
Network > Adapter 1 > Ok
Network > Adapter 2 > Enable Network Adapter > Checked
Network > Adapter 2 > Attached to: Host-only Adapter
Network > Adapter 2 > Ok


Login to your VM and make sure that it is accessible over your host-only network
adapter and SSH runs on boot... Just important stuff... ya know?

# su -
# chkconfig sshd on
# service sshd restart
# iptables -F
# service iptables save

Find the Host-Only network IP for your VM:
# ifconfig

Edit this file, placing the ip address into a new line:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Xming\X0.hosts

If you already have xming running, restart it.

On the VM, we need some SSH keys made for easy access:
# ssh-keygen -t rsa
# cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Save this output as a plain text files in Windows OS.
# cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Create a PPK file with PuTTYgen. In PuTTYgen, use the "Conversions" drop down
and select "Import Key". From that, I selected my SSH key, clicked "Save public key",
named it FedoraVM.ppk and was done.

Now we need to edit the launcher batch script:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Igknighted/Notebook/master/VirtualBox/Nautilus_Launcher_(Example).bat

Replace 192.168.56.1 with whatever the gateway is for the Host-Only adapter from
your VM. It can be found with this command:
# netstat -nr

Change the username demon to your VM's username.

Change C:\Users\Samuel\Documents\SSHKeys\FedoraVM.ppk to the full patch on windows
where you saved the new key PPK file.

Change 192.168.56.101 to the same IP your VM is using from the host only adapter that
you found with this command:
# ifconfig

Note: May need to update these file paths based on install paths you chose:
C:\Program Files (x86)\PuTTY\plink.exe
C:\Program Files (x86)\Xming\Xming.ex
