What does this do?
==================
This setup will sync all usernames and user IDs from one server to another. It's good for environments where usernames and ID's have to made due to a shared file system.

Steps for setup:

Create SSH key pair with no passphrase:
# ssh-keygen -t rsa

Take the .pub file you create, cat it:
# cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Append the contents of that file to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote server:
root@REMOTE_SERVER # vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Now on the 'user' server, we need to setup the userxchange script to run. Do the following:

# cd /opt
# wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Igknighted/Notebook/master/lazy/sync_users/userxchange.sh
# crontab -e

Add this line to the crontab and save: (replace __IP__ADDRESS__HERE__ obviously)
*/5 * * * * /opt/userxchange.sh __IP__ADDRESS__HERE__ 2>&1 > /dev/null

Done...
